- Limit unnecessary RPL$ tables
- Run in one single service

LIVEMIRROR MISC

- Feature to create full copy of master database, instead of backup/restore
- Port to Linux and MacOS
- Enable replication to secondary mirror
- Make it possible to dissociate replication from config, so that you can have all the config in one server, and then have several instances somewhere else, just replicating.
- Make mirror database preparation module
- Support 64-bit
- Support MacOS
- TCcConfig.GenerateConfig : auto-detect PK change
- Enable Unlimited licence
- Translate Delphi RTL
- Meta-data synchronization
- Fail-over and restore features, so as to easily switch the mirror database into production mode (add triggers, etc), so that the changes made during downtime will be logged, and then be able to sync them back to production datbase when it goes back online.
- Create LiveMirror server so that you can use compressed RTC network protocol
- Disable triggers on mirror

COPYCAT 3.10.0

- Android access violation fix
- Finish and test comparer
- Update trigger creation mechanism for other databases, as well as PK sync stuff
- Batch operation procedure : store SQL in RPL$LOG and don't fire triggers - maybe handle meta-data the same way
- Add misc information to RPL$LOG (transaction number, etc)
- If trigger can't be created, give a clear error message stating table name and text of trigger

COPYCAT MISC

- Flag to stop replication until validation (boolean flag in RPL$LOG, so that changes will only be sent after validation)
- Dynamic included/excuded fields (handled in triggers)
- Meta-data replication
- Store primary key names in RPL$LOG so PK change can be handled seamlessly
- Support for MERGE / IF EXISTS for MS SQL / MySQL
- Test MySQL replication over FireDAC / MyDAC / ADO

- Document PK sync mechanism
- Optimize blob management so that they don't get copied around in memory for nothing
- Use memory string to directly copy blobs from one connector to another or from TCcMemoryRow to connector without loading into memory
- Raise an error if PKSynchronization = false and there are PK sync statements in RPL$TABLES
- Include precompiled ADO, FireDAC and DataSnap connectors
- Use msbuild for compiling
- Separate into Runtime and Designtime packages so that you can add unit uses for CcDB
- Implement missing features in other DBs compared to Firebird
- Check issue with connection loss : http://copycat.fr/wordpress/discussions/#/discussion/64/critical-bug

- Update local RPL$LOG rows after synchronizing primary keys when in ReplicateOnlyChangedFields
- Translate CopyCat messages
- Store node connection information in RPL$USERS ? http://copycat.fr/wordpress/discussions/#/discussion/29/store-all-information-for-physical-nodes-in-the-master-remote-source-database

COPYCAT
